# Home Mortgage Lending Activities of Banks in Hartford, Connecticut
The project assesses patterns of bank lending in Hartford’s neighborhoods and determine what banks are effective at investing in Hartford’s low income neighborhoods and which are not.

Data source: 
The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires many financial institutions to maintain, report, and publicly disclose loan-level information about mortgages. These data help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of their communities; they give public officials information that helps them make decisions and policies; and they shed light on lending patterns that could be discriminatory. The public data are modified to protect applicant and borrower privacy.

This project uses HDMA record data from  2011 to 2015 for Hartford Metro Area from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)'s database.

Abstract

In Spring 2017, I collaborated with the Hartford Community Loan Fund, a non-profit that provide and promote just and affordable financial services that benefit the low-wealth residents of Hartford, through a Data Visualization course at Trinity College. OUr project aims to assess patterns of bank lending in Hartford’s neighborhoods in order to determine what banks are effective at investing in Hartford’s low income neighborhoods and which are not. Using public data for the Hartford metro area from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, I developed an interactive digital map to visualize loan approval rates for different neighborhoods, creating a broad visual analysis of where banks are located and where loans are frequently approved.

Nhat, James, and Rex are continuing their work this summer, this time joined by Ken Haas (‘21), Professor Diane Zannoni (Economics), and Professor Carol Clark (Economics). Nhat is serving as an intern at HCLF, and she and Ken will be CLI Research Fellows in 2017-18, mentored in this project by Zannoni and Clark. The group is expanding Nhat’s original analysis in two ways. First, loan applications in the Hartford Metropolitan area will be analyzed to determine the effects on loan approval of the applicant’s individual characteristics and neighborhood characteristics. Second, a variety of quantitative techniques will be used in the analysis. Through this analysis, they hope to offer hard data and research to civic leaders and community organizations in Hartford along with local banks to illuminate current loan practices, while encouraging area banks to use home mortgage lending as a way to increase investments in currently underserved areas of the city and to uphold their CRA obligations at the same time.

This work over the summer has also made possible further partnership with Zannoni’s Basic Econometrics students, who spend the fall semester working in groups to examine and conduct econometric analysis of large data sets. In the process of doing their research over the summer, the group has cleaned up and prepared two data sets, application materials and census tract materials, for further analysis. Zannoni’s students in the fall will be able to investigate these data further, asking questions such as : Who received loans and who didn’t? What individual factors seem to contribute to those decisions?
